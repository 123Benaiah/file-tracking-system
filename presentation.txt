## SLIDE 9: FILE WORKFLOW

**Complete File Lifecycle**

1. **Registration** → Auto-generated number, status: at_registry
2. **Sending** → Select recipient, status: in_transit
3. **Receiving** → Confirm receipt, status: received
4. **Processing** → Review file, status: under_review
5. **Returning** → Back to registry, status: completed
6. **Merging** → Copies merged, history preserved

**Audit Trail**: Every action logged with timestamp, user, IP address
